# DungeonGame

Hello! This was a project that I worked on in December 2021 and January 2022. The basic framework of the game is based off a Dungeon Crawler made by Youtuber HexagonNico. Here is the GitHub link: https://github.com/HexagonNico/Dungeon-Crawler. 

Although my game uses much of HexagonNico's code, I also added some features of my own. For example, I:
- Designed my own dungeon generation algorithm
- Designed my own enemy pathfinding algorithm that moves the enemies based on the angle between them and the player
- Added an 8-direction shooting system for the player

Throughout the course of the project, I learned more about
- Object Oriented Programming
- Enum constants
- How planning and coding carefully can often lead to a more smooth programming experience
